# Sample STAT 545/547 participation repository

I'll be using this repository to demonstrate where to put in-class work for [STAT 545A/547M](stat545.com/Classroom) at UBC.

Each lecture has its own folder, prefaced with `cm`, containing that day's work.

__Students__: It's OK if your participation repo is not identical to this one. In fact, it shouldn't be! We're more concerned about your commit history as opposed to the contents of the repo, anyway.
